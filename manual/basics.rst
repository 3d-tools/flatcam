By running File→Save Project, File→Save Project As… or File→Save a Project Copy… you are saving everything currently in the environment including project options. File→Open Project… lets you load a saved project.

Source Files
------------

Supported source files are:

* **Gerber**: Typically define copper layers in a circuit board.
* **Excellon**: (drill file): Contain drill specifications, size and coordinates.
* **G-Code**: CNC machine instructions for cutting and/or drilling.

These source files can be loaded by selecting File→Open Gerber…, File→Open Excellon… or File→Open G-Code… respectively. The objects created from source files are automatically added to the current project when loaded.

Navigating Plots
----------------

Plots for open objectsPlots for open objects (Gerber, drills, g-code, etc…) are automatically shown on screen. A plot for a given can be updated by clicking “Update Plot” in the “Selected” tab, in case any parameters that would have changed the plot have been modified.
