=============================================

(c) 2014 Juan Pablo Caram

FlatCAM is a program for preparing CNC jobs for making PCBs on a CNC router.
Among other things, it can take a Gerber file generated by your favorite PCB
CAD program, and create G-Code for Isolation routing. But there's more. See
the features list below.

* Powerful user interface for visualization.
* Viewers for: Gerber, Excellon, G-Code.
* Create isolation routing geometry from Gerber.
* Create optimized G-Code from geometry.
* Double sided PCB tools.
* Clearing copper areas.
* Measuring tool (planned).
* PCB cutout tool.
* Table flattening tool.
